FASTA reader & DNA to AMINO ACID converter

The project deals with reading a Fasta file and providing the corresponding amino acid sequence. FASTA is a readable text-based, bioinformatic data format used to store nucleotide or amino acid sequences. The given code reads a FASTA file here, for example a Corona Viruses DNA sequence .

TRANSCRIPTION:- The DNA is transcribed to the corresponding mRNA sequence. Here in the code the DNA sequence is transcribed to the mRNA by complementary base pairs.

CODON FORMATION:- The then produced mRNA sequence forms the triplets of the nucleotides. Similarly the code furthur shows the codons formed in the mRNA sequence.

TRANSLATION:- Translation is the process where the codon sequence results for the formation of the amino acid sequence. The translation process strats when the start codon i.e Methionine (Met or M) codon [AUG] and stops at the stop codon [UAA or UAG or UGA]. Here using the looping concepts and arrays we can form the correspping amino acid sequence with proper start at Met amino acids and stop at the stop codons .
